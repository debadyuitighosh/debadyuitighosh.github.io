## About Me

Hailing from the city of Barrackpore in Kolkata, Debadyuiti joined Ashoka in the fall of 2023, pursuing a Ph.D. in Cosmology. After obtaining an M.Sc. in Physics from RKMVERI, Belur (West Bengal) in 2021, his childhood curiosity about the cosmos shaped further into researching the evolution of our universe. His research work broadly concerns theoretical models that study the epoch of Cosmological Inflation â€“ a period when the universe underwent exponential expansion after the Big Bang. His PhD supervisor is Prof. Suratna Das. When entangled deep in the equations or the computer simulations of the early universe, Debadyuiti fancies escaping on his cycle, exploring previously unexplored roads under clear blue skies. One might also find him in the late evenings, dabbling with the racquet at the university campus badminton court
